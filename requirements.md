# Requirements for Google Keep Clone

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask or FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL (for simplicity)
- **Docker**: 
  - Dockerfile for the backend
  - docker-compose.yml for multi-container setup (if needed)
- **Security**:
  - HTTPS for secure communication
  - JWT or OAuth for authentication
  - End-to-end encryption for data

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Preact or HTML/CSS
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility with mobile and desktop
- **API Integration**: Connect to the backend for CRUD operations

## Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git
- **IDE**: Cursor IDE (for development)
- **Testing**: Unit tests for backend functionality
- **Linting**: Use linters for code quality (e.g., flake8 for Python)

## Documentation
- **README**: Instructions for setup and usage
- **API Documentation**: Describe endpoints and data formats
- **Architecture Overview**: Brief description of the system design

## Educational Focus
- Emphasize learning outcomes and best practices in software development.
- Encourage exploration of Docker, security practices, and frontend frameworks.


ased on my analysis, here's what we should focus on next:
Docker Setup Completion:
Our Docker setup is quite comprehensive with:
Multi-stage build for optimization
Security considerations (non-root user)
Health checks
Complete docker-compose setup with PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and Nginx
However, we should verify:
The docker-entrypoint.sh script
SSL certificate setup for HTTPS
Volume permissions
Documentation Priority:
We need to create/update:
API documentation with endpoint descriptions
Architecture overview document
Complete README with setup instructions
Development guidelines
Frontend Tasks:
Verify responsive design implementation
Complete GitHub Pages deployment
Ensure all API integrations are working
Test frontend-backend integration thoroughly
Development Tools:
Set up flake8 for Python linting
Implement code quality checks
Add pre-commit hooks if not already present
Would you like me to focus on any of these areas specifically? I'd recommend starting with either:
Completing the documentation to ensure proper project handoff and maintenance
Setting up the development tools for code quality
Verifying the Docker setup with SSL certificates
Which area would you like to tackle first?
