# Project Prompts for Google Keep Clone

## Overview
Create a fully-functional and interactive Google Keep clone application. The application should have a Python backend running in a Docker container, fully secured, load balanced, and with end-to-end encryption. The frontend should be lightweight, using Preact or simple HTML/CSS, and hosted on GitHub Pages. This project is for educational purposes only.

## Requirements
1. **Backend**:
   - Use Python (Flask or FastAPI) for the backend.
   - Implement CRUD operations for notes (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Support basic multimedia (images, audio) uploads and previews.
   - Ensure the backend is secured (authentication, authorization).
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for data storage and transmission.
   - Containerize the application using Docker.
   - Set up load balancing for scalability.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Use Preact or simple HTML/CSS for the frontend.
   - Create a user-friendly interface for managing notes.
   - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
   - Integrate with the backend API for CRUD operations.
   - Host the frontend on GitHub Pages.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Provide a Dockerfile for the backend.
   - Include a `docker-compose.yml` file for multi-container setup if needed.
   - Ensure the application can be easily deployed and run locally.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Include a README file with setup instructions.
   - Document the API endpoints and usage.
   - Provide a brief overview of the architecture and technologies used.

## Additional Notes
- Focus on simplicity and educational value.
- Ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Use version control (Git) for the project.
